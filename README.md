# Modern Engineering Accelerator

> Accelerating Through Excellence

The Modern Engineering Accelerator is a comprehensive platform that demonstrates how to achieve sustainable speed in software development through strong engineering foundations. It emphasizes that true acceleration comes from mastering Continuous Delivery (CD) and Extreme Programming (XP) principles before leveraging AI capabilities.

## 🎯 Vision

Build a foundation for sustainable speed in software development by:

- Establishing strong CD/XP practices as the cornerstone
- Implementing quality-focused Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Leveraging AI to accelerate already-solid engineering practices

## 🎨 Brand Identity

- Primary Color: `#FE6A3A`
- Modern, clean typography
- Professional and technical aesthetic

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
