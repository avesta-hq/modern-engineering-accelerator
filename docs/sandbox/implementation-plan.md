# Implementation Plan

## System Test First Approach

[Explanation of why we start with system tests]

## Implementation Phases

### 1. Initial Setup

- Repository structure
- CI/CD pipeline skeleton
- Development environment setup
- Initial documentation

### 2. Backend Implementation

- Clean Architecture setup
- Domain model implementation
- Use case implementation
- Infrastructure layer setup

### 3. Frontend Implementation

- Component architecture
- UI implementation
- State management
- API integration

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Unit testing approach
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Contract testing

### 5. Pipeline Implementation

- Commit stage setup
- Acceptance test stage
- UAT stage
- Release stage
