# Introduction to Engineering Excellence

In today's fast-paced tech world, there's a common misconception that we must choose between speed and quality. Organizations are rushing to embrace AI and other cutting-edge technologies, hoping these tools will help them move faster.

However, as Dave Farley emphasizes in "Continuous Delivery":

## The Foundation for Speed

True speed in software development comes from:

1. Strong engineering practices (XP)
2. Reliable, repeatable processes (CD)
3. Built-in quality
4. Automated processes

## Our Approach

This guide will show you:

1. Why XP and CD are fundamental to moving fast
2. How to implement these practices effectively
3. Real-world examples through our CD Sandbox project
4. Practical pipeline implementation

## Getting Started

Start your journey with:

1. [Why CD Matters](./why-cd-matters.md)
2. [CD Principles](./cd-principles.md)
3. [XP Practices](./xp-practices.md)

Remember: To move fast sustainably, you need strong engineering foundations.
