# Comprehensive Docusaurus SEO Optimization Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process for enhancing the SEO of your Docusaurus-based documentation site. Follow these instructions to improve search engine visibility and ranking.

### **Step 1: Technical SEO & Configuration**

#### 1.1. Analyze `docusaurus.config.js`

- **Goal:** Ensure foundational site settings are correct for production.
- [ ] **URL Configuration:** Verify that the `url` and `baseUrl` fields are correctly set for your production domain.
- [ ] **Site Metadata:** Review the site-wide `title` and `tagline`. Optimize them to be descriptive and include primary keywords like "Continuous Delivery" or "Modern Engineering Practices".
- [ ] **Sitemap Plugin:** Ensure the `@docusaurus/plugin-sitemap` is installed and enabled in the `plugins` array. If it's missing, add it.

#### 1.2. Create `robots.txt`

- **Goal:** Guide search engine crawlers and point them to your sitemap.
- [ ] **Create File:** Create a new file at `static/robots.txt`.
- [ ] **Add Content:** Populate it with the following rules, replacing `[YOUR_SITE_URL]` with the actual production URL from your config:
  ```
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Sitemap: [YOUR_SITE_URL]/sitemap.xml
  ```

### **Step 2: Content and On-Page SEO**

For **every** Markdown file (`.md`, `.mdx`) within the `docs/` directory, perform the following actions:

#### 2.1. Develop Page-Specific Keywords

- **Goal:** Define a clear keyword strategy for each page.
- [ ] For each document, identify one **primary keyword** (e.g., "Continuous Delivery Principles") and 2-4 related **secondary keywords** (e.g., "CD best practices," "agile software development").

#### 2.2. Enhance Front Matter

- **Goal:** Add essential SEO metadata to each page.
- [ ] **Add `title`:** Add a unique and descriptive `title` to the front matter. This populates the `<title>` tag and should be 50-60 characters long, containing the primary keyword.
- [ ] **Add `description`:** Add a compelling `description`. This will be the meta description in search results. It should be a 150-160 character summary that includes the primary keyword.
- [ ] **Add `keywords`:** Add a `keywords` array containing the primary and secondary keywords identified for the page.

**Example for `docs/foundation/cd-principles.md`:**

```markdown
---
title: Core Principles of Continuous Delivery (CD) for Modern Engineering
description: Discover the fundamental principles of Continuous Delivery (CD) that enable engineering teams to deliver software faster and more reliably.
keywords:
  [
    continuous delivery principles,
    cd best practices,
    modern engineering,
    agile development,
  ]
---

# Page content starts here...
```

#### 2.3. Optimize Images

- **Goal:** Improve accessibility and provide context for images to search engines.
- [ ] Scan each document for images (`![]()`).
- [ ] Ensure every image has descriptive `alt` text. If `alt` text is missing or generic, replace it with a clear description.
- **Good Example:** `alt: 'Diagram showing the four stages of a CI/CD pipeline: Commit, Acceptance, UAT, and Production.'`

#### 2.4. Implement Internal Linking

- **Goal:** Build site authority and guide users to relevant content.
- [ ] Identify opportunities within the text to create internal links to other relevant pages on the site.
- [ ] Use relative paths for the links (e.g., `../pipeline/overview.md`). For instance, if a page mentions "Test Shield," it should link to the `test-shield.md` document.

### **Step 3: Final Review**

- [ ] After implementing all changes, review the site locally (`npm run start`) to ensure no broken links or formatting issues were introduced.
- [ ] Once confirmed, deploy the changes to production.
