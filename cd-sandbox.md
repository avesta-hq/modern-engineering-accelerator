The idea is people say today we want to move fast, embrace AI. I want to express that in order to move fast we need to learn the fundamentals of engineering to move fast.

I want to then highlight the role of XP and CD principles and practices in moving fast. I want to highlight Dave Farley has said in the first page of CD book. I have attached the screenshots of the CD book first chapter.

We need to build the foundation to move fast and XP and CD are the foundation and then we can levarage AI to move faster.

Then I have set up the XP and CD technical practices.

The CD pipeline is set up. I have implemented automated tests based on Modern Test Pyramid principles. You can find more details here: https://journal.optivem.com/p/modern-test-pyramid-visual

The CD pipeline is set up. You can refer to these images for more details:

The purpose of this repo is to demonstarte the foundation of moving fast. Also to scale learning. This is the XP/CD Sandbox project where developers can learn and practice XP and CD principles and practices. This is not a coding kata or a ToDo App. This is a real world sandbox project. The idea is from here: https://journal.optivem.com/p/legacy-code-sandbox-project?utm_source=publication-search But this is not TDD Sandbox project. This is a XP/CD Sandbox project.

And finally we can even productize this sandbox project. We can create a SaaS product out of this. We can sell this to organizations to help them learn and practice XP and CD principles and practices.

This is a demo of our Test Shield Service. We will add these pages on last.

I have also idea of integrating some features from CodeScene with the Test Shield Service. Where the team can learn about the code health and code quality and technical debt and refactoring targets and hotspots.

Did you got the overall idea? We will build this site from scratch. You need to refer to my repos:

- digital-kudos-wall
- digital-kudos-wall-system-tests
- digital-kudos-wall-frontend
- digital-kudos-wall-backend
- digital-kudos-wall-infrastructure

We will create the plan and site layout first and then proceed with creating the pages.

I also have the color palette and typography if we can use that.
