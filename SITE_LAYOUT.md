## Development Approach

1. Set up basic structure with placeholder pages
2. Review and adjust structure based on feedback
3. Implement foundation section with CD book content
4. Add sandbox project documentation
5. Document CD pipeline with diagrams
6. Add advanced topics
7. Review and refine each section iteratively

Would you like me to proceed with creating this structure, or would you like to review and adjust this layout first?
